# MVVM - Album Sample

Introduction
------------

The application uses Clean Architecture based on MVVM and Repository patterns. Implemented
Architecture principles follow Google recommended [Guide to app architecture](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide).


Android Jetpack is a set of components, tools and guidance to make great Android apps. They bring
together the existing Support Library and Architecture Components and arranges them into four
categories:


* [Foundation][0] - Components for core system capabilities, Kotlin extensions and support for
  multidex and automated testing.
  * [AppCompat][1] - Degrade gracefully on older versions of Android.
  * [Android KTX][2] - Write more concise, idiomatic Kotlin code.
  * [Test][4] - An Android testing framework for unit and runtime UI tests.
  * [Architecture][10] - A collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and
  maintainable apps. Start with classes for managing your UI component lifecycle and handling data
  persistence.
  * [Data Binding][11] - Declaratively bind observable data to UI elements.
  * [Lifecycles][12] - Create a UI that automatically responds to lifecycle events.
  * [LiveData][13] - Build data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
  * [Navigation][14] - Handle everything needed for in-app navigation.
  * [Room][16] - SQLite database with in-app objects and compile-time checks.
  * [ViewModel][17] - Store UI-related data that isn't destroyed on app rotations. Easily schedule
     asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.
  * [Paging][19] - Load and display small chunks of data at a time.
* [UI][30] - Details on why and how to use UI Components in your apps - together or separate.
  * [Layout][35] - Lay out widgets using different algorithms.
  * [Material][36] - Material Components.
* Third party
  * [Kotlin Coroutines][91] for managing background threads with simplified code
     and reducing needs for callbacks.
  * [Dagger 2][92] A fast dependency injector.
  * [Retrofit 2][93] A configurable REST client.
  * [OkHttp 3][94] A type-safe HTTP client.
  * [GSON][95] A Json - Object converter using reflection.
  * [Glide][90] Image loading.
  * [Timber][96] A logger.
  * [Stetho][97] Sophisticated debug bridge.
